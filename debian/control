Description: resource and network access abstraction
 KDE Input/Output framework provides a single API for
 operating on files, whether local or on a remote server.
 Additionally, KIO Slaves provide support for individual
 protocols. Some particularly useful ones are http, ftp,
 sftp, smb, nfs, ssh (fish), man, tar and zip.
